## MySql Wrapper


</div>

### Description

This is designed as a wrapper to the MySQL API, it is a windows dll and just needs compiling and registering before adding a reference to your projects, it provides a means of accessing a MySQL database as you would using ADO. This is the second and final version and has been compiled and tested with both VB6 and VB.NET and works very well with both. Please give feedback on this as it will help me to improve on it. Also please feel free to suggest anything that you would like to see in future version of this dll.
 
### More Info
 
Please ensure that when you compile the application that you dont name the dll output file libmysql.dll as this will conflict with the MySQL API dll
